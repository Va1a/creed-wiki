1. Wandering Trader
 * The wandering trader is the main way to receive magical items. It will trade a variety of magic items with you. The trader can have 7-14 trades each time it spawns. The given trades it will have are random.
2. Looting
 * Many of the magical items you need to trade with the wandering trader can be found by looting structure chests, such as ocean ruins or jungle temples.
3. Meteors
 * Every now and then, a meteor will crash into the overworld. Meteors always have great custom loot that will aid you in trading with the Wandering Trader.
