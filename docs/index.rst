**Welcome to the Creedcraft Wiki!**

This is the official documentation for creedcraft magic items.
Use the sidebar to access the information you need. First time here? Keep reading to get a quick summary.

1. Wandering Trader
 The wandering trader is the main way to receive magical items. It will trade a variety of magic items with you. The trader can have 7-14 trades each time it spawns. The given trades it will have are random.
2. Looting
 Many of the magical items you need to trade with the wandering trader can be found by looting structure chests, such as ocean ruins or jungle temples.
3. Meteors
 Every now and then, a meteor will crash into the overworld. Meteors always have great custom loot that will aid you in trading with the Wandering Trader.
4. Mana
 The amount of mana you have is displayed in the mana bar, which can be found above your hunger bar. Mana is required and deducted when using most (but not all) magical items. Mana regenerates naturally on its own, but you can also use items to regenerate mana faster.
5. Starting Items
 When beginning on Creedcraft, you are provided with 5 potions of divine winds and 1 teleportation opuscule. These are rare magic items and you should try your best to not lose them (But don't be afraid to use them when you need to!). The **splash potion of divine winds** teleports everything in the area of its splash to a random location. It is useful when trying to get away from spawn, but it has a limiting radius of around 5 thousand blocks, so it is not too useful for getting very far. The **teleportation opuscule** can be renamed to another player's username to allow you to teleport to them. Be advised that the player you are trying to teleport to must also be holding an opuscule but it must have your username at the time of teleportation.
